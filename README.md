This repository will contain files for our capstone project on "IoT based Cradle system using SIDS monitor".

Iot based cradle system enables monitoring of baby 24 hours and identifies any danger to life by SIDS Monitor which detects heartbeats of baby. The system is consists of

1)Oxygen and pulse monitor Units
2)Crying Detection Unit     
3)Swing Controller unit     
4)Wetness detector unit    
5)Video Surveillance unit

These five units synchronised to work with each other and altogether makes a complete IOT based baby monitoring cradle system.

**Features of our project:-**
SIDS monitor (sudden infant death syndrome)
Cry detection
Wetness detection
